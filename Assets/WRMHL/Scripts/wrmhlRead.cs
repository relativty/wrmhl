/*
This script is used to read all the data coming from the device. For instance,
If arduino send ->
								{"1",
								"2",
								"3",}
readQueue() will return ->
								"1", for the first call
								"2", for the second call
								"3", for the thirst call

This is the perfect script for integration that need to avoid data loose.
If you need speed and low latency take a look to wrmhlReadLatest.
